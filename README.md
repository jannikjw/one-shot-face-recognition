# One Shot Face Recognition
This project deals with one-shot learning for face recognition. Faces need to recognized reliably using a single surveillance 
camera.

## Project Objective
When customers need to check in at a bank location (either via app or in person), one way for identification is through face verification. It is critical to robustly verify/recognize people’s faces with different facial expressions, lighting conditions, accessories, and hairstyles given one or a few template photos. Failure to do so may lead to serious security issues. One unique challenge in the banking industry (and many other domains) is that typically only one image/picture of the customer’s face is given,
yet the face recognition system needs to stay robust even with one shot. Thus, this project focuses on one-shot learning for face recognition.
